# GitHub Models Cookbooks

This folder contains cookbooks for interacting with GitHub Models in several languages. Similar cookbooks are available on model providers' websites, but have been altered here to interact with the GitHub Models service.

- [Python](python/README.md)

The samples were modified slightly to better run with the GitHub Models service.
