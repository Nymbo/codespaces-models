# GitHub Models Cookbooks - Python

This folder contains cookbooks for interacting with GitHub Models using Python. Similar cookbooks are available on model providers' websites, but have been altered here to interact with the GitHub Models service.

- [OpenAI](openai/README.md)
- [Mistral AI](mistralai/README.md)
- [LlamaIndex](llamaindex/README.md)
- [LangChain](langchain/README.md)

The samples were modified slightly to better run with the GitHub Models service.
